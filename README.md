# The "Almost" Classic Tetris
## Purpose
This project is for task H1 of SIT102.

## Overview
Welcome to Tetris!
You probably come across this because you are looking for the classic game code. Well, you are in the "could say' wrong place. But hey, test out my version of Tetris. I built it from scratch and added some of my touch to it. It has most of the original features, except for the box showing upcoming pieces. Why? More challenging, of course. It also has different background music and SFXs, well, because it is my version. Enjoy the game.

## Requirements
